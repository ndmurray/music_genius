A progenitor of funk music and a major figure of 20th century popular music and dance, he is often referred to as the \"Godfather of Soul\".[2] In a career that lasted 50 years, he influenced the development of several music genres.[3]\n\nBrown began his career as a gospel singer in Toccoa, Georgia. He joined an R&B vocal group, the Gospel Starlighters (which later evolved into the Flames) founded by Bobby Byrd, in which he was the lead singer.[4][5] First coming to national public attention in the late 1950s as a member of the singing group The Famous Flames with the hit ballads \"Please, Please, Please\" and \"Try Me\", Brown built a reputation as a tireless live performer with the Famous Flames and his backing band, sometimes known as the James Brown Band or the James Brown Orchestra. His success peaked in the 1960s with the live album Live at the Apollo and hit singles such as \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\", \"I Got You (I Feel Good)\" and \"It's a Man's Man's Man's World\". During the late 1960s he moved from a continuum of blues and gospel-based forms and styles to a profoundly \"Africanized\" approach to music-making that influenced the development of funk music.[6] By the early 1970s, Brown had fully established the funk sound after the formation of the J.B.s with records such as \"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\" and \"The Payback\". He also became noted for songs of social commentary, including the 1968 hit \"Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud\". Brown continued to perform and record until his death from pneumonia in 2006.\n", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/--Joan_Baez": "\nJoan Chandos Baez (/ba\u026az/;[1] born January 9, 1941) is an American folk singer, songwriter, musician, and activist[2] whose contemporary folk music often includes songs of protest or social justice,[3] Baez has performed publicly for over 60 years, releasing over 30 albums.
