He was among the earliest tenor players to adapt the bebop musical language of people such as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Bud Powell to the instrument. Gordon's height was 6\u00a0feet 6\u00a0inches (198\u00a0cm), so he was also known as \"Long Tall Dexter\" and \"Sophisticated Giant\". His studio and live performance career spanned over 40 years.\n\nGordon's sound was commonly characterized as being \"large\" and spacious and he had a tendency to play behind the beat. He was famous for humorously inserting musical quotes into his solos. One of his major influences was Lester Young. Gordon, in turn, was an early influence on John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. Rollins and Coltrane then influenced Gordon's playing as he explored hard bop and modal playing during the 1960s.\n", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/--Janis_Joplin": "\nJanis Lyn Joplin (/\u02c8d\u0292\u0252pl\u026an/; January 19, 1943 \u2013 October 4, 1970) was an American rock singer and songwriter; one of the most successful and widely-known female rock stars of her era.[1][2][3] After releasing three albums, she died of a heroin overdose at the age of 27.
